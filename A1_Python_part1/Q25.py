# Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

# - The number must be divisible by five

# - If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

# - If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
# ```
# numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
# ```

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for i in numbers:
    if i % 5 == 0 and i <= 150:
        print(i)
    elif i> 500:
        break
